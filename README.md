# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Income Dataset
# Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand the factors that influence income levels. The analysis includes examining relationships between various demographic and economic features and the target variable, income. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can inform further predictive modeling.
Project Structure
# The project repository is organized as follows:
•	data/: Contains the dataset file.
•	notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the EDA.
•	images/: Contains visualizations and plots generated during the EDA.
•	README.md: This README file.
•	requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the notebooks.
# Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebooks and perform the EDA, you will need the following Python packages:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Analysis Workflow
1.	Data Loading and Cleaning:
*	Load the dataset using pandas.
*	Handle missing values and incorrect data types.
*	Perform basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution of data.
2.	Data Visualization:
*	Use matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and box plots.
*	Visualize the distribution of each feature and its relationship with the target variable, income.
3.	Feature Engineering:
*	Create new features based on existing data to enhance the analysis.
*	Encode categorical variables and handle ordinal data.
4.	Correlation Analysis:
*	Calculate correlation coefficients to understand the relationships between features.
*	Use heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix.
5.	Insights and Observations:
*	Summarize key findings and insights from the EDA.
*	Identify potential features for predictive modeling.
