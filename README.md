# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL
# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 datasets using SQL to answer various queries and derive meaningful insights about the pandemic's spread, impact, and trends. The analysis focuses on metrics such as total cases, new cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions across different countries and continents over time.
# Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
*	data/: Contains the dataset files (data1.csv and data2.csv).
*	queries/: Contains SQL scripts for different queries and analyses.
*	README.md: This README file.
# Requirements
*	To run the SQL queries, you will need a SQL database system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Ensure that the database system is installed and properly configured.
# Upload _death .py :
*	By using these file we can upload our CSV file into MYSQL through cmd.

# Analysis Workflow
1.	Data Loading:
*	Import the datasets into your SQL database. This can be done using appropriate SQL commands or a database management tool.
2.	Data Cleaning and Preparation:
*	Clean and preprocess the data as needed. This may include handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency.
3.	 Exploratory Analysis:
*	Perform SQL queries to explore the data and extract key insights.
*	Examples of queries include:
*	Total and new COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.
*	Trends in hospital and ICU admissions.
*	Comparison of COVID-19 metrics across different continents and countries.
# Results and Insights:
*	Summarize the findings from your SQL queries.
